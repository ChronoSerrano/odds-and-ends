# Calibre Tools

## [LibraryThing Add](library_thing_add.tmpl)
This is a template used for an LT Add column to add a missing book to your LibraryThing profile.  It's an extension of an example provided in the [LibraryThing Match plugin's site](https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=337516), but adds ASIN and ISBN searches as well.
